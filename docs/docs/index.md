ecoTeka is an internal project, managed and developed by Natural Solutions. It is part of the biodiversity and green spaces community.Â 
Our ambition is to become the benchmark in green asset management and we have set ourselves 3 lines of action:

1. Develop the capacity to make an accurate and exhaustive inventory of nature in the city
2. Improve its management
3. Be a recommendation force

For this we will propose a web and mobile platform for green space managers. However, we want ecoTeka to be more than a simple tool, so we are also working on webinars and trainings related to differentiated management, the choice of a plant palette, urban green frames, etc... to support the transition of jobs in this sector!
